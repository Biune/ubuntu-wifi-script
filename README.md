## Ubuntu WiFi Script | *script.sh*

---

This script runs when you place the script.sh file in the directory that Ubuntu is in. This is meant for server versions of Ubuntu. This can create/edit network-config (with your wifi information) and enable ssh (creates a file called ssh)

---

#### Features:

Functions that the script can do are:
- Create/edit a file with your network information.
- Enable SSH on startup.
- Self-destruct when finished.
